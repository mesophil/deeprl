Vibing

## TODO
- Class training losses - target classes with higher losses

- run again with entropy coefficient

- Train the model from scratch when the program starts - should be easy now that we have cifar implemented by default
    - Instead, have a bunch of pretrained models

- transfer learning instead of retraining from scratch ? / finetuning

- Implement different architectures, e.g. ViT
